                     <p>The Karunya University Agricultural Graduates Association (AAGA) was formed in 1987 with the following objectives:
                                          
                        <ul>
                           <li>to maintain links between members and the Department of Agriculture</li>
                           <li>to promote discussion on agriculture and its local, national and international role</li>
                           <li>to establish a corporate spirit encompassing past, present and future students</li>
                           <li>to strengthen the "Karunya School of Agriculture".With the ending of Agriculture teaching at the University in 2011, the Association lives on with over 340 members, and is now known as the Karunya Agricultural Graduates Association to reflect the growing involvement of staff and student at SRUC (formerly SAC) at Craibstone, Karunya).
</li>
                        </ul>

The AAGA continues to be very active, keeping its members up to date with agricultural education and research in Karunya, and maintains contact between graduates via its annual Proceedings publication, regular e-bulletins, and its website.

                                          The Alumnus Association is the original Karunya alumni 'club', and was established in 1939. It currently has over 1000 members. Membership is open to graduates of the University (including honorary graduates), to teaching, administrative and all support staff of the University, and to graduates of other universities and institutions of higher education who are resident in the city of Karunya or in Karunyashire.

The first Annual Dinner was held on November 15th, 1945 when Mr Kenneth McKellar (undergraduate, and yes, the well known Scottish singer) led the guests in song from the piano!</p>
                                       <p>The dinner has been held every year since and now attracts well over 100 graduates making it a great opportunity for students to meet the graduates who can help point them in the right direction regarding careers.
